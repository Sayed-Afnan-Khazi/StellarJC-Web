    <h2>WHAT ARE BLACK HOLES?</h2>
    <p>A black hole is a cosmic phenomenon characterized by an immensely strong gravitational force that ensnares even light. This gravitational intensity stems from matter being compacted into an incredibly small volume, typically happening when a star nears the conclusion of its life and experiences a profound collapse.
    </p>
    <h2>IS IT POSSIBLE TO OBSERVE A BLACK HOLE?</h2>
    <p>We're unable to directly observe black holes with the naked eye since they don't emit light and therefore appear invisible. However, specialized space telescopes equipped with specific instruments can aid in detecting black holes. By studying the unique behaviors of stars in close proximity to black holes compared to other stars, researchers can infer the presence and characteristics of these elusive cosmic entities.</p>
    <h2>HOW BIG ARE BLACK HOLES?</h2>
    <p>Black holes exhibit a range of sizes, from minuscule, atom-sized entities to those with the mass of a mountain. Stellar black holes can reach up to 20 times the sun's mass, while super-massive black holes exceed a million suns. Every significant galaxy houses a confirmed super-massive black hole at its core.</p>
    <h2>HOW DO BLACKHOLES FORM?</h2>
    <p>Black holes exhibit a range of sizes, from minuscule, atom-sized entities to those with the mass of a mountain. Stellar black holes can reach up to 20 times the sun's mass, while super-massive black holes exceed a million suns. Every significant galaxy houses a confirmed super-massive black hole at its core.</p>
    <h2>HOW DO BLACKHOLES FORM?</h2>
    <p>Scientists believe the tiniest black holes originated during the universe's inception. Stellar black holes manifest when a massive star's core implodes, triggering a supernova—an explosion propelling star fragments into space. Additionally, super-massive black holes are theorized to have formed concurrently with their respective galaxies.</p>
    <h2>ARE BLACKHOLES TRULY BLACK? CAN WE DETECT THEM?</h2>
    <p>Black holes are identified by the gravitational pull that funnels surrounding material, like gas, into a swirling disk. The fast-moving gas molecules in this disk generate X-rays, detectable from Earth. While a black hole remains visually imperceptible due to gravity capturing all light, scientists study its impact on nearby stars and gas. When a black hole and a star are in proximity, they emit high-energy light, unseen by the human eye, necessitating space satellites and telescopes for observation</p>
    <h2>DO BLACKHOLES POSE ANY THREAT TO US?</h2>
    <p>Black holes do not wander through space consuming stars, moons, or planets. Earth is not at risk of being pulled into a black hole since there are no black holes close enough to our solar system for that to occur. Even if a black hole with the same mass as the sun were to replace the sun, Earth would maintain its orbit.</p>
    <h2>ARE BLACKHOLES IDENTICAL TO WORMHOLES?</h2>
    <p>No, black holes and wormholes are distinct. Wormholes can be envisioned as conduits connecting two distinct points in space-time. It's conjectured that the inner regions of black holes might host wormholes—ruptures in space-time offering a gateway to another space-time point, possibly even within a different universe.</p>

    content:`A Wonder off the Earth

    Humanity has always loved the idea of ranking everything that came its way. The most fantastical of these categorizations has been the idea of the 7 wonders of the world. These are seven of the best marvels of human world. They represent the might of the human race and its creativity. These incredible monuments inspire in us the pride of how great human achievement is. Their physical massiveness magnifies this message. Such architectural marvels are the representatives of the great human will, effort and unity. 
    <br><br>It was less than 60 years ago, when man set foot on the Moon. Conquest of space, and investigation of its wonders, is considered to be the greatest and most exciting challenges humankind faces today.
    <br><br>By these standards, the greatest monument built by us might not be one of the seven on earth; the most extraordinary human adventure in space may not be Armstrongs Moon-landing. But, the construction of the International Space Station.
    <br><br>The project, which began as a US effort in 80s (plan announced in 84), was long delayed by funding and technical problems. It began to take a concrete form only after the end of the Cold War when, in 1993, Russia decided to join the international collaborative for building the ISS. In 1986, the Soviet Government had already started building its own space station, the MIR (Russian for peace). Their technical know-how, but especially their experience, was crucial to the success of ISS. Construction began in 1998. The US space shuttle had to ferry material back-and-forth to the MIR space station. On November 20, 1998, The first large piece of ISS, a freight and control module, was “installed” in space, 220 miles above the Earth. In the same year, a connecting piece, the Russian living quarters module “Svesda”, was attached by means of a docking maneuver. From November 2000 to April 2003, the ISS was underconstruction with a rotating three member crew permanently in space. Each ISS crew team spent 5 to 7 months in space before being relieved by the next crew.
    <br><br>Due to the 2003 Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, progress on the ISS slowed down, and for a time, all construction was stopped. With all American space shuttles grounded, the ISS crew was reduced to two members re-supplied by Soviet Soyuz spacecraft. In 2005 the Russians took over the larger part of the project. In 2006, NASA was once again able to provide special flights for provisioning and materials transport. Other elements were subsequently joined to the station, with the overall plan  calling for a complex of laboratories and habitats crossed by long a truss supporting 4 large solar power arrays. Station construction involved at least 16 countries, including Canada, Japan, Brazil, and  11 members of the European Space Agency. Much of the early work about the ISS focused on long-term life sciences and material sciences research in the weightless environment. It was expected to serve as the basis of human space operations in Earth orbit for at least until 2025.
    <br><br>The ISS, is no doubt a magnificent example of what humanity if united, can achieve. Its length along the major axis of the pressurized sections is 66 m, total habitable volume of the sections is 387 meters cubed. Its weight is about four 450 tons. Costing around 15,000 crore USD, the ISS is the largest satellite in low-Earth orbit (LEO), regularly visible to the naked eye from Earth’s surface. At an average altitude of 400 km, it circles/orbits Earth every 93 minutes (approx), completing 15.5 orbits a day.
    <br><br>It has also become an attractive destinations for multibillionaire tourists!
    <br><br>The ISS has conducted a lot of research; its operations and achievements demand an article of their own!`
